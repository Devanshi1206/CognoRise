## Data Analysis:

I used various Machine Learning Techniques to complete all of these projects.

Project 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION :
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species). 
So for the classification of the flower, I used the Logistic Regression Machine machine-learning technique.

Project 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
I utilized three machine-learning techniques to detect credit card fraud. 
The ML models used are logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest.

Project 3: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Project 4: SUPERSTORE SALES PREDICTION

Project 5: CAR PRICE PREDICTION
