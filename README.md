## Data Analysis:

I used various Machine Learning Techniques to complete all of these projects.

Project 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION :

- The dataset contains 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species). 
- So for classification pourpose, I used the Logistic Regression Machine machine-learning technique.

Project 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION :

- I utilized three machine-learning techniques to detect credit card fraud. 
- The ML models are logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest.

Project 3: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION :

- I used Machine Learning Techniques like:
    - Logistic Regression,
    - Decision Tree,
    - Random Forest,
    - Support Vector Machine,
    - Gradient Boosting,
    - K-nearest neighbours,
    - Neural Network.
- Out of which 3 models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) provided 100% accuracy.
- So, I used the Random Forest Classifier to predict all the survivors correctly.

Project 4: SUPERSTORE SALES PREDICTION :

- I used Machine Learning Techniques like XGBoost and Random Forest Regressor.
- Out of which Random Forest Regressor provides better results.

Project 5: CAR PRICE PREDICTION :
    
- The performance of various regression models on the dataset was evaluated.
- Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBRegressor showed strong performance on both training and testing sets, with low RMSE and MAE, and high R2 Score.
    
Project 6: SHOPPER SENTIMENTS :

- I used the NLP to predict the sentiments of the shoppers or the customers with the help of reviews provided.
- In this various NLP techniques like tfidf and Linear SVC.
